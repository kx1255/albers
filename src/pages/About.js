                <h6>My joint senior project focuses on color theory pedagogies in the Information Age. For the Education Studies component, I aim to investigate the teaching practices of color theory in Reggio Emilia, Montessori, and Waldorf educational approaches, both historically and in contemporary contexts. For the CPAR component, I developed this web app. The project aims to make color theory more accessible to students who may not have access to paint materials.<br/><br/>
                Despite being an integral aspect of visual communication, access to color theory instruction in U.S. high schools can be compromised if funding for arts education changes. In fact, since the creation of No Child Left Behind, many schools reallocated funds intended for arts programming to remedial learning classes. This is truly a shame because studies have shown that underrepresented and minority students participating in arts education classes performed better on academic tests and with long-term career goals. <br/><br/>
                With the rapid advancement of technology and the proliferation of digital media in the 21st century, students today are exposed to an unprecedented array of visual stimuli. This digital landscape presents both opportunities and challenges for color theory pedagogy, which I hope to illuminate through my research. Understanding the principles of color theory is essential not only for artists but also for individuals in various fields, from design to marketing, and even psychology. Ultimately, this exploration of color theory pedagogy seeks to empower young learners, fostering their creativity, visual literacy, and appreciation for the transformative power of color.
